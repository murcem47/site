# [poop.fart][poop.fart]

My personal website and blog, powered by [Jekyll][jekyll].

## Setup

If you're going to poop my fart and host it yourself, use [GitHub Pages][github-pages].

For local pooping:

- Be sure you have [Ruby][ruby] installed and configured
  - `gem install bundler`
  - `bundler`
  - `bundler exec jekyll serve`
- Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:4000>

You'll want to edit [\_config.yml][config.yml] to point to your domain as well, if you catch my fart.
